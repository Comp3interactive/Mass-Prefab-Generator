# Mass-Prefab-Generator
A Unity utility for creating multiple prefabs at once, saving you time from manually dragging and dropping each game object into your project folder!

**How to use:**
- Create your prefab objects in the hierarchy as you normally would (add your components / set up initial values etc)
- Input the desired output folder name in the Path Name input box **-OR-** select your desired folder in the project window and hit Update Location Folder to perform this automatically
- Select all objects you want to prefab in the scene view using Shift+Click or CTRL+Click and hit Build Prefabs.
- Every selected object will now be converted into a prefab and stored in your desired folder!
- Note: Depending on the number of objects / complexity of the objects you're converting this may take a few seconds
